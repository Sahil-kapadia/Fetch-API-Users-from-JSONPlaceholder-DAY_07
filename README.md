### Fetch **API** Users — Mini Web Project
This project demonstrates how to fetch and display user data from a public **REST** **API** using the JavaScript Fetch **API**. The goal is to understand how asynchronous requests, **JSON** parsing, and basic **DOM** manipulation work together inside a real webpage.
The data is pulled from the free JSONPlaceholder **API** and displayed in neatly styled user cards. A reload button is included so the data can be fetched again without refreshing the page. Basic error handling is also implemented, which helps test how the page behaves when the network is disconnected or the **API** fails.

Features
Fetches user data from: [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)
Displays each user’s:
Name
Email
Address

Reload button to manually trigger **API** calls
Error message display when something goes wrong
Clean and responsive layout
Hover effect on user cards
Checks if the user is offline before attempting a fetch

### Tech Used
**HTML5** for structure
**CSS3** for styling and layout
JavaScript (**ES6**+) for fetching and rendering **API** data
No external libraries or frameworks are used — everything is written in plain JavaScript.

**How to Run the Project**
Download or clone the project files.
Make sure the following three files are in the same folder:
index.html
style.css
script.js

Open index.html in any modern browser.
Click the Reload button to fetch the user data.
If you want to test error handling, try turning off your internet connection and clicking Reload again.

### Project Structure
/project-folder 
│── index.html 
│── style.css 
└── script.js

index.html: Main layout and elements
style.css: Card design, grid layout, hover effects, typography
script.js: Fetch logic, error handling, **DOM** updates

Why This Project?
This is a small but practical example of real-world JavaScript usage. It covers the essentials you need to know before working with larger APIs or front-end frameworks:
Making network requests
Working with **JSON** data
Updating the **DOM**
Handling failures gracefully
Writing clean, modular code

It’s simple enough for beginners but still demonstrates concepts used in real applications.
